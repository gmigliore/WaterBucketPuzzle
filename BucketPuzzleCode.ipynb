    "Suppose you have 8L, 5L and a 3L bucket with you. The buckets have no measurement lines on them, \n",
    "and you are asked to measure exactly 4L of water using the three buckets. How could you measure \n",
    "exactly 4L water using only those buckets and provided you have as much extra water as you need?\n",

    "Intructions:\n",
    "The game will ask you to \"fill, pour, or empty.\" Type the full word, in lowercase for these next line.\n",
    "It will then ask which bucket you would like to act on, type \"8 or 5 or 3\".\n",
    "Once you get one of the buckets to equal four the game will stop."
